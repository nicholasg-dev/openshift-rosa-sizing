# Enhanced Metrics Collection Development Log

## Overview
This feature branch (`feature/enhanced-metrics-collection`) enhances the OpenShift ROSA Sizing Tool by adding cluster node sizing information collection to the metrics gathering process.

## Goals
1. Add functionality to collect actual cluster node sizing information (CPU, memory, instance types)
2. Improve the output format to include both usage metrics and cluster sizing
3. Maintain backward compatibility with `calculate_sizing.py`
4. Improve error handling and user feedback

## Implementation Plan
1. Modify `collect_metrics.py` to add node sizing collection
2. Ensure backward compatibility with existing `calculate_sizing.py`
3. Test with various scenarios
4. Document changes and usage

## Changes Log

### 2023-11-15: Initial Implementation
- Created feature branch
- Added `collect_cluster_sizing()` function to gather node information
- Added helper functions for parsing resource strings
- Modified output structure to include both metrics and sizing information
- Maintained backward compatibility with `calculate_sizing.py`
- Improved error handling for partial data collection

### 2023-11-15: Fixed Sizing Baseline Display
- Fixed issue with sizing baseline display in the report
- Modified `load_metrics()` in `calculate_sizing.py` to handle both original and new key names
- Added support for new metric key names (cpu_usage, memory_usage, pod_count, storage_usage_pvc)
- Ensures correct display of sizing baseline values in the report

## Compatibility Notes
- The enhanced script maintains the original output structure expected by `calculate_sizing.py`
- New data is added under additional keys that don't interfere with existing functionality
- Original metric keys (`cpu`, `memory`, `pods`, `storage`) are preserved alongside new keys (`cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, etc.)
- The script can now collect partial data (e.g., sizing only) if Prometheus metrics collection fails
- Default output filename changed to `cluster_data.json` but users can still specify any filename with `--output`

## Implementation Details

### New Features
1. **Cluster Sizing Collection**: Added functionality to collect and analyze node information
2. **Resource String Parsing**: Added helper functions to parse Kubernetes resource strings
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Script can now continue with partial data collection
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility with `calculate_sizing.py`

### Key Changes
1. Changed default output filename to `cluster_data.json`
2. Added `collect_cluster_sizing()` function to gather node information
3. Added `parse_cpu()` and `parse_memory()` helper functions
4. Modified output structure to include both metrics and sizing information
5. Improved error handling to allow partial data collection
6. Added more detailed summary output
