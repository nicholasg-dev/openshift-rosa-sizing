    Nodes Required: 3 (limited by HA Minimum)
    Utilization: CPU 1.4%, Memory 0.7%
    Total Capacity: 192 vCPUs, 1536 GB Memory

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
  Minimum Worker Nodes: 3
  Recommended Worker Nodes: 3 (for high availability)
  Storage Recommendation: 20 GB minimum

NOTES:
  - ROSA includes managed control plane and infra nodes (typically on m5.xlarge instances)
  - Recommendations focus on worker nodes which handle application workloads
  - 3+ worker nodes recommended for high availability
  - Multiple availability zones recommended for production environments
  - For small workloads, utilization may be low due to the 3-node minimum requirement
  - For larger deployments, utilization targets are 30-80% for both CPU and memory
  - Use AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate costs based on these recommendations
